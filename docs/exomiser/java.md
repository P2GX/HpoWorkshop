# :material-coffee-outline: Installing Java

Exomiser is a [Java](https://www.java.com/en/){:target="_blank"} application.
To run it locally, you need a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed on
your laptop.

Running Exomiser during the workshop is **optional** — there will be plenty
to do even if you choose not to install Java.

!!! tip "New to Java?"
    If installing software feels unfamiliar, don’t worry — you can still
    complete all workshop exercises without running Exomiser from the
    command line. Feel free to skip this step if you prefer.
