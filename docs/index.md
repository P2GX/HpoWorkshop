!!! note "Preparing for the workshop"

    This workshop combines short lectures with practical exercises.
    It is intended for **bioinformaticians, clinicians, and translational researchers**
    working with the HPO or related software.

    If you would like to prepare in advance:

    - Read the [background articles](./introduction/reading.md){:target="_blank"}

    There will be many activities in the workshop. Optionally, users can run Exomiser on their own laptops. If you would like to do this, please

    - Install a [Java runtime environment](./exomiser/java.md)
    - Download the Exomiser [software and data files](./exomiser/cmdline.md)

      The data files are roughly **20 GB**, so please download them before
      the workshop if you plan to run Exomiser locally.
