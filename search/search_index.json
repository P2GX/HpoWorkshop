Biomedical ontologies act as a \u201cRosetta stone\u201d for medical terminology, providing interoperability across resources and enabling sophisticated computational analysis. </p> <p>The HPO is a rich representation of the diversity of human phenotypes and, due to its logical structure, it enables computational inference of combined genomic and phenotypic analysis in basic research and the clinic. Examples include genomic interpretation for diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, genotype-phenotype analysis, mechanism discovery, and EHR cohort analytics\u2014all of which assist in realizing the promises of precision medicine. Since 2008, the HPO team has developed free and open community resources consisting of the HPO itself and a comprehensive corpus of phenotype annotations (HPOA) for more than 8,500 rare diseases. The HPO team also developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics, genomic diagnostics, and translational research. The HPO is the global standard in rare disease research and diagnostics, evidenced by the fact that it is used to support clinical care and translational research in rare diseases in myriad academic and commercial software packages, is a Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) resource, and has been translated into 10 languages with 6 in progress. By enabling data exchange, HPO unites an ever-growing community of diverse users and contributors across the world, illuminating the natural history of disease, revealing new diseases, supporting patient registries and phenotype-driven genomic diagnostics, and numerous national genomic initiatives and biobanking programs. In the previous funding period, we developed the Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) to integrate HPO and HPOAs with a computational representation of diagnostic modalities, treatments, and other clinical measures.</p> <p>This workshop intends to provide a general introduction to HPO and some computational tools that leverage HPO.</p> <ul> <li>Robinson et al (2008) The Human Phenotype Ontology: a tool for annotating and analyzing human hereditary disease.

For example, if an ontology classifies \u201cvirus\u201d as an infectious agent and classifies \u201cinfectious meningitis\u201d as a type of meningitis due to an infectious agent, then it would conclude that \u201cviral meningitis\u201d is a subclass of \u201cinfectious meningitis.\u201d Aristotle developed conceptual taxonomies that are in some ways similar to modern bio-ontologies.13 More recently, scientists have used the word \u201contology\u201d to denote a computational representation describing specific domains of knowledge.

Computable relationships can be represented among diseases, phenotypic features, genes, and environmental exposures by interlinking terms (concepts) from sources including the Orphanet Rare Disease ontology (ORDO) (pink denotes diseases),14 the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)15 for phenotypic features (orange), the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology for the chemical compounds (green denotes factors such as chemical exposures that can influence severity or trigger development of disease),16 and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations for the comet assay (single-cell gel-electrophoresis assay) of DNA breakage (aqua),17 as well as the Gene Ontology (lavender denotes a biologic pathway)18 and the Reactome for molecular pathways (blue denotes disease genes and mode of inheritance).19 Ontologies can be used to support the integrative analysis of these data sources for precision stratification and treatment and to clarify underlying mechanisms, as suggested by the dashed lines. The labeled arrows between concepts represent description-logic definitions that specify the formal relationships between the concepts. FA-A denotes Fanconi anemia, complementation group A; FA-B, complementation group B; and so on. In the diagram of the Fanconi anemia pathway, the blue circles represent the proteins encoded by the Fanconi genes (e.g., A is the protein encoded by FANCA), and the grayish-blue ovals represent other interacting proteins; P denotes phosphorylation, and ub ubiquitination..</p>"},{"location":"introduction/reading/","title":"Background Reading","text":"<p>To prepare for the workshop, we recommend reading the following foundational publications.
